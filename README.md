The MyToken smart contract is an implementation of a simple token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. Below is a detailed description of its components and functionality:

Token Details
The contract defines a token named "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK". It has a totalSupply variable to keep track of the total number of tokens in existence.

Public Variables
name: This public variable stores the name of the token, which is "MyToken".
symbol: This public variable stores the symbol of the token, which is "MTK".
totalSupply: This public variable keeps track of the total supply of the tokens. It is initially set to zero and changes as tokens are minted or burned.
Balances Mapping
The contract uses a mapping called balances to store the balance of tokens held by each address. This mapping associates an address with a corresponding token balance.

Mint Function
The mint function allows the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters:

_to: The address to which the newly created tokens will be assigned.
_value: The number of tokens to be created.
When the mint function is called, it increases the totalSupply by the specified _value and adds the same amount to the balance of the _to address.

Burn Function
The burn function allows the destruction of existing tokens. It takes two parameters:

_from: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
_value: The number of tokens to be destroyed.
Before burning the tokens, the function checks if the _from address has a sufficient balance to burn the specified amount. If the balance is sufficient, the function decreases the totalSupply by the _value and subtracts the same amount from the balance of the _from address. If the balance is not sufficient, the function reverts with an "Insufficient balance to burn" error.

Overall, this contract allows for basic token management, including minting new tokens and burning existing tokens, while keeping track of balances for each address and the total supply of tokens in existence.
